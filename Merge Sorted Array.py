Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of the elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Mege nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that shouldbe merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

class Solution:
  def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
    midx = m = 1
    nidx = n -1
    right = m + n - 1
    
    while nidx >= 0:
      if midx >= 0 and nums1[midx] > nums2 [nidx]:
        nums1[right] = nums1 [midx]
        midx -= 1
      else:
        nums1[right] = nums2[nidx]
        nidx -= 1
      right -= 1
